# Credit Risk Predictor

## Introduction
This project aims to develop a predictive model to determine the likelihood of an individual obtaining a loan. Additionally, a user-friendly application has been created to enable users to input their personal information and connect to the model, receiving immediate feedback regarding their loan approval probability.

## Project Scope

1. Develop a predictive model to assess loan approval likelihood.
2. Create a user-friendly application for users to input personal information and integrate the model for real-time loan probability feedback.
3. Ensure the model does not exhibit any form of bias, especially given its probabilistic nature. Investigate potential bias in the model to raise awareness of any prejudices when interacting with a bank.
4. Explore the possibility of having the application provide recommendations to improve a loan applicant's chances of approval.

## Predictive Analytics
AI utilizes data analysis techniques such as logistic regression, historical data, and relevant features to forecast loan decisions based on an individual's information.

## Enhanced Risk Assessment
AI algorithms analyze extensive data using tools like logistic regression and inferential analysis to aid in assessing the risks associated with loan approval. This results in more precise risk assessments, leading to improved underwriting decisions and reduced loan loss risks.

## Process Optimization
AI, employing techniques like logistic regression on historical transactional data, identifies areas where the lending process can be enhanced. Streamlining operations and optimizing workflows can boost efficiency, reduce costs, and offer a superior experience for both lenders and borrowers.

## Fraud Detection
AI employs fraud detection using machine learning algorithms to scrutinize loan applications, identifying potential fraudulent activities. This ensures the integrity and security of the loan process, protecting both loan experts and clients from fraud.
